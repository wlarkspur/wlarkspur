- 👋 Hi, I’m @wlarkspur

My major is Russian language and culture, and worked in Russia about 5 years.
I was charged in localization, production automobile parts.

I think the time was came to change my circumstance, enough worked in Russia and automobile production.
4~5 years before I'd learned C++ my self, but i quit because it was too confused and nothing motivated me, moreover i concetrated learn in Russian.

Now, I decided to become a great development, that realize my imagination, purpose and future.
